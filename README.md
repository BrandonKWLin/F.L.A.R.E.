# F.L.A.R.E.
F.L.A.R.E. (Fire Location and AI Response Engine) uses NASA data and AI to broadcast wildfires like those in California—helping communities act early, save lives, and reduce healthcare burdens.

Disclaimer:
You will need to add your Google Maps API key in the Map.js component and register for a NASA API key at https://api.nasa.gov. Additionally, this is also very buggy and W.I.P. At the moment, only drought and wildfires work.
